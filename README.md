# Shades

Shades is Dart's missing colour library.

Need to work with colours in your Dart code? Then use this library to help create, manipulate, and format them for output.

Currently in very early stages.

### TODO

* Support all standard CSS colour strings
* Transforms (lighten, darken, spin, etc)
